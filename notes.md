# What I tried

## How to find the shortcut of a given node

In the beginning, I wanted to first pick up a value for the distance and then to
uniformly pick a node among the equidistant nodes. Unfortunately, this does not
reduce the problem because the distribution is not easier to compute as the grid
is finite and there is no symmetry.

I then implemented a shortcut generator using a precomputed grid of distances:

    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(1 if i==0 else 0, N):
            d = distance(0, 0, i, j) ** (-r)
            global_distance_grid[N+i-1, N+j-1] = d
            global_distance_grid[N-i-1, N+j-1] = d
            global_distance_grid[N-i-1, N-j-1] = d
            global_distance_grid[N+i-1, N-j-1] = d

I extract then the local grid of distances from this global map, normalize it,
and randomly pick an element using this distribution.

Building the initial distance grid takes 3'40" on a single core, for N = 10000
(time complexity = O(NÂ²)), and the grid is cached on disk.

This state is referenced by the git tag `basic-shortcut-finder`.

## The routing algorithm

Here I used no special technique but instead implemented the routing algorithm.
We only compute the shortcut if we need it, and if it has a equivalent distance
to what provide the neighbors, we don't use it.
If both neighbors allow to progress, we uniformly pick one.

I used parallelization to use all my cores.

I then call `run_routing` for different values of `r`.

This gives the following (surprising) graph for N=100 and Ntries=10000:

Crap, I did not write my code to use different values of r in the first place,
and now I am always using the same r!

## MemoryError

Quickly enough I notice that the memory consumption is quite huge and that I
need to reduce the problem. I chose to come back to my initial idea, that I
rejected, because I thought... hmm well... Actually the idea was good (just a
bit more complex to implement):

1. we compute the number of destination nodes at distance `d`, as if the grid was infinite;
* the distribution is then "vector of number of nodes at distance i" * "d ^ (-r) for all the possible distances";
* pick a distance d according to the distribution;
* uniformly pick a node at this distance: if the node is out of the grid, start over from step 3.

By doing so, we remove the solutions out of the grid from the potential
destination nodes, which is equivalent to removing them from the initial
distribution since we try again.
